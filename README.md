### A2Z Business Performance Target Project
Business Problem/Needs
- The management of A2Z Business company wants me to review the revenue performance across all nation stores. The manager, Mr. John Kelvin, wants to know which stores made the highest variance (Revenue - Target) and the days profitable for sales. He desires to give some days off to the best store and provide a special salary increment <img width="3118" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102f5f37-fe66-4f2a-a42a-6ec7f0cb1bbc" />

My FIndings/ Key Insight
- The data team carried out this project using the PACE FRAMEWORK. 
The LEE-MYERS store made the most variance with 31.1%, which is the difference between the total revenue and total profit. Their best revenue generated was in the first and third quarters, with Sundays, Saturdays and Wednesdays the most profitable days.

- In order to understand the impact of this project, I carried out an Exploratory Data Analysis for each store’s dataset, comparing their total revenue with monthly target.  
Base on this analysis, the manager was able to notice the Novak PLC Store. This store has never meet their target for the whole year.

Dataset Provided

- Monthly store target

My Recommedations
- A2Z should implement the strenth of LEE MyER store and other trieving store, in other stores that are struggling.
- Strategics marget campaign should be carried out based on figures (data analysis)
