## 🚀 Projects

This template showcases how i solve business problems in different situations.

## Project Title One

### A2Z Business Performance Target Project
#### Business Problem/Needs
*The management of A2Z Business company wants me to review and analyze their revenue performance across all stores. The manager, Mr. John Collins, wants to know which stores were able to meet their target for the year, which store made the highest variance (Revenue - Target) and the days profitable for sales. He desires to give some days off to the best store and provide a seperate salary increment for them* 

#### My FIndings/ Key Insight
- *Despite the four stores meeting their targets and four stores not meeting their target, A2Z Business Ltd was able to suppase their taget for the year with 3.7%*
-  *Out of the eight stores owned by A2Z Business LTD, four store were able to impressively exceed their targets for the year with The LEE-MYERS store making the most variance of 31.1% increase, which is the difference between the total revenue and total target. Their best revenue generated was in the first and third quarters, with Sundays, Saturdays and Wednesdays the most profitable business days.*
- *Other store like Lopez, Barron Fleming, and Myer Lopez store exceeded their target with 30%, 29.5% and 26.7% respectively* 
- *Base on my analysis, the manager was able to notice the Novak PLC Store and other stores that did poorly. Novak store never met their monthly target for the whole year, with difference of -24.6%.* 

In order to understand the impact of this project, I carried out an exploratory and statistical analysis for each store’s dataset, comparing their total revenue with monthly target.  


#### Dataset Provided
- Customers record
- Monthly store targets
- Products Record
- Sales record

#### My Recommedations
- *A2Z should implement the strenth of LEE MyER store and other thrieving stores, in other stores that are struggling.*
- *Strategics marketing campaign should be carried out based on figures (data analysis) from store performance*

#### Tools Used For This Project
*This project was done and completed with Microsoft Excel. A responsive and automated dashbord was also created*
